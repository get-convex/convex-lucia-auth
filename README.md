# Convex Database Adapter + UI for Lucia Auth Library

This library enables authentication built entirely on top of Convex without any third-party platform. It uses [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) for the authentication logic.

Features:

- Without any additional setup, you can sign in with an email+password combination
- Sign out button
- Session is preserved in `localStorage`
- Passwords are securely hashed

This integration works! You can see a production deployment at this live site: https://get-convex.github.io/convex-lucia-auth-demo/.

## Install

```
npm install @convex-dev/convex-lucia-auth
```

Checkout [Docs](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-lucia-auth/blob/master/DOCS.md) for how to integrate the library into your app.

## Deploying to production

In your production deployment's settings page configure these variables:

- `LUCIA_ENVIRONMENT`=`PROD`
- `HOSTNAME`=where the app is hosted, such as `foo.github.io` or `mydomain.com`

## Note on CSRF protection

The React components use `localStorage` for storing the secret `sessionId`. This means that sessions are only preserved on pages served on the same subdomain, such as `foo.example.com` or `username.github.io`. This prevents CSRF attacks.

This does though invite an [XSS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Make sure your app is not susceptable to XSS.

Convex currently doesn't support accessing cookies in queries and mutations, so cookie-based authentication can only be used in Convex HTTP actions.

# What is Convex?

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is a hosted backend platform with a
built-in database that lets you write your
[database schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) and
[server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/typescript). Server-side database
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) automatically
[cache](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching--reactivity) and
[subscribe](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#reactivity) to data, powering a
[realtime `useQuery` hook](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#fetching-data) in our
[React client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react). There are also
[Python](https://docs.convex.dev/client/python),
[Rust](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust),
[ReactNative](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react-native), and
[Node](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript) clients, as well as a straightforward
[HTTP API](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-js/blob/main/src/browser/http_client.ts#L40).

The database support
[NoSQL-style documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-storage) with
[relationships](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) and
[custom indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/indexes/)
(including on fields in nested objects).

The
[`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[`mutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) server functions have transactional,
low latency access to the database and leverage our
[`v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) with
[determinism guardrails](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#using-randomness-and-time-in-queries-and-mutations)
to provide the strongest ACID guarantees on the market:
immediate consistency,
serializable isolation, and
automatic conflict resolution via
[optimistic multi-version concurrency control](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ) (OCC / MVCC).

The [`action` server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) have
access to external APIs and enable other side-effects and non-determinism in
either our
[optimized `v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) or a more
[flexible `node` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

Functions can run in the background via
[scheduling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) and
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs).

Development is cloud-first, with
[hot reloads for server function](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server) editing via the
[CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli). There is a
[dashbord UI](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard) to
[browse and edit data](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data),
[edit environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables),
[view logs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs),
[run server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions), and more.

There are built-in features for
[reactive pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination),
[file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage),
[reactive search](https://docs.convex.dev/text-search),
[https endpoints](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) (for webhooks),
[streaming import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/), and
[runtime data validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#validators) for
[function arguments](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/args-validation) and
[database data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#schema-validation).

Everything scales automatically, and it’s [free to start](https://www.convex.dev/plans).
